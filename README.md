8x8 Circuit Sculpture of Conway's Game of Life

This project is the collection of files necessary to make the pictured 8x8 grid sculpture playing out [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). In total, 130 hours were spent developing this project after completing a previous (100+ hour) 6x6 circuit sculpture representation which had previously maxed out the Atmega 328P computer's resources. This time was spent refactoring the original program for efficiency, conceptualizing the full design from scratch, modeling the wooden case in Fusion360, designing the circuit boards in KiCad and then importing to Fusion360 to produce CNC gcode, cutting the wood and copper/fr4 circuit boards on an Onefinity CNC machine (many times due to failed cuts), soldering and assembling the circuits, testing and improving the design while in progress, as well as assembly and final cleanup work. The project was created to demonstrate practical implementation of a data structure (all the way from concept to final working hardware) for a classroom grade. Unfortunately, the project did not count for very much credit, however the entire process was very therapeutic and educational, and I'm very pleased with the results.
